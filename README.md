# Your Tooling Journey Start Here

Welcome to the Topcon Sitelink3D v2 API tools repository. 

If you've read our documentation [here](https://github.com/Sitelink3D-v2-Developer/sitelink3dv2-api-documentation) and have already run some of our examples [here](https://github.com/Sitelink3D-v2-Developer/sitelink3dv2-examples) then perhaps you're looking for some extra bling to bring your site data to life. That’s where these tools fit in.

This repository contains a collection of functionality that demonstrates what can be achieved with the use of the Sitelink3D v2 API. Rather than just extracting raw data, we provide some inspiration at the presentation layer that you can modify or base your own functionality on.

So make a cup of coffee and let’s get started!

# Repository Structure
The structure of this repository is delineated by functional areas:

## AsBuilt
A standalone example of a Cesium map based HTML AsBuilt viewer capable of displaying sequences at your QA or production site.

## Reports
Excel spreadsheets that demonstrate some data analysis and visualization based on the output of our reports.
